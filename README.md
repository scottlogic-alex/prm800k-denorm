This repository will be home to a script for converting OpenAI's [PRM800K](https://github.com/openai/prm800k/tree/main) process supervision dataset to a denormalized format in `.parquet` file type, for easier consumption.

# Setup

Copy the PRM800K and MATH datasets into the `prm800k` directory, in accordance with [`prm800k/README.md`](prm800k/README.md).
